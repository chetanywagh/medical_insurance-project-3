This project is a **Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Tool** designed to help individuals estimate their insurance premiums quickly and accurately based on personal and health-related information.

**Business Need / Problem:**  
- Healthcare and insurance costs are rising rapidly.  
- Individuals often struggle to **understand how factors like age, BMI, lifestyle, and region affect insurance premiums**.  
- There is a need for a tool that provides **instant, reliable estimates** to aid in financial planning.

**Key Features of This App:**  
- **Predict Medical Insurance Costs** using a trained Machine Learning model.  
- Takes inputs like **age, BMI, number of children, sex, smoking habits, and region**.  
- Displays results in **INR (‚Çπ)** for better clarity.  
- Clean, interactive UI built with **Streamlit** for ease of use.

**Value to Users:**  
- Helps individuals **plan finances and choose insurance plans wisely**.  
- Provides **quick insights** into factors affecting insurance costs.  
- Can serve as a foundation for more **personalized insurance advisory tools** in the future.

üöÄ **Get Started:**  
Switch to the **Prediction** tab, fill in your details, and see your **predicted medical insurance cost instantly**!
